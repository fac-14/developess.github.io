      Hi, I'm Jessie. I'm a 24-year-old web developer based in
      London. I love exploring, learning and all things technology. You can

    <h2>Why I love to code</h2>
    <p>
      Coding for me is a perfect mix of creativity and science. Creativity in the
      sense of using imagination and style, but also in the literal sense of
      making something, and the great satisfaction that comes with that. I have
      always loved studying sciences and computer science has proven no different!
      Programming can be scientific and mathematical and processes in tech are often
      highly methodological, which really appeals to me.
      <br>
      <br>
      From what I have experienced, the tech community has been welcoming, friendly,
      and full of people eager to learn and help others learn too. I hope to contribute
      to this community as a student and teacher in years to come!

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Aside from my development career, I love attending meet ups and tech
      events in London and working on personal projects. Outside tech, I
      enjoy running, yoga, cooking and crafts (including origami).
    </p>
    <p>
      Before teaching myself to code, I ran the finances for a start-up creative
      agency and recruitment company. Frustrated by my inability to create the
      tools I wanted, I took an online course in JavaScript and have hardly
      looked back since.
